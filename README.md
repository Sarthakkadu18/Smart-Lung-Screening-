# Smart-Lung-Screening-
Smart Lung Screening is a web-based application that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze CT scan images of lungs. Its primary goal is to provide a quick, preliminary assessment of whether an image shows signs of being cancerous or non-cancerous. It's designed as an accessible tool to aid in the early detection of lung cancer.
